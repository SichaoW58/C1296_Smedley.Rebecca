summary(VADeaths)

#' Here's some more prose. I can use usual markdown syntax to make things
#' **bold** or *italics*. Let's use an example from the `dotchart()` help to
#' make a Cleveland dot plot from the `VADeaths` data. I even bother to name
#' this chunk, so the resulting PNG has a decent name.

dotchart(VADeaths, main = "Death Rates in Virginia - 1940")
